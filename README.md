# Conway’s Game of Life — Interactive Python Simulation

**This is my first project, developed during my first semester of college.**  
It is a full implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**, a zero-player cellular automaton where simple rules generate surprisingly complex and emergent behaviors. The simulation is built using **Python**, taking advantage of **Pygame** for real-time rendering and **NumPy** for efficient grid updates.

The system updates in real time and allows complete user interaction — you can draw cells, erase them, play/pause the simulation, adjust speed, randomize patterns, and observe dynamic structures like oscillators, gliders, and more.  
This project represents my first deep dive into programming logic, visualization, and computational thinking.

## 🧬 Game Rules (Conway’s Game of Life)

The simulation runs on a grid of cells. Each cell is either **alive** or **dead**, and its fate is determined by four rules:

1. **Underpopulation**  
   A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies.

2. **Survival**  
   A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives to the next generation.

3. **Overpopulation**  
   A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies.

4. **Reproduction**  
   A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.

Despite these simple rules, the system produces rich behaviors such as oscillators, gliders, still-lifes, and complex evolving structures.

## 📘 How It Works

- The grid is represented as a 2D NumPy array.  
- Each frame, the simulation calculates neighbor counts for every cell using vectorized operations.  
- Based on the Game of Life rules, a new grid is generated and rendered onto the screen.  
- Pygame handles the window, drawing, mouse input, and frame updates.  
- The user can modify the grid at any time, even while the simulation is running.

This creates an interactive environment where the user can experiment with emergent patterns and real-time system evolution.

## 💡 Significance as My First Project

This project holds special significance for me because it marks my **first real programming build**, created in my first semester of college.  

It became my gateway to:  
- thinking about algorithms,  
- understanding how simulations work,  
- learning event-driven programming,  
- exploring visualization,  
- debugging real systems,  
- and gaining confidence in my ability to bring ideas to life.

It taught me that even beginner-level concepts can produce complex results when you implement them with clarity and consistency.

2. **Algorithm Initialized and Game follows the Rules**

   - The Live cells are interacting with the dead cells which inturn makes new cells born with green color and turns white whereas the living cells which are            white when dies changes color to red.

3. **Final Result**

   - The Cells which are alive due to the Rules and which are still generating and dying are shown.
