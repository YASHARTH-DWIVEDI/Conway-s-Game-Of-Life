# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life
-What is Conway's Game of Life?
 •Definition: Conway's Game of Life is a mathematical model and cellular 
automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970.
 •It's not a traditional "game," but rather a simulation of cell evolution 
based on simple rules.
-Basic Rules of the Game
 •Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
 •Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.
 •Death: All other live cells die or remain dead.
-Visualization and Simulation.
 •The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells.
 •Cells can be in two states: alive (filled) or dead (empty).
 •Simulation progresses in discrete time steps, with cell states 
evolving based on neighboring cells.
-Real-World Applications
   Practical uses:
   •Modeling predator-prey relationships.
   • Image processing for pattern recognition.
-WORKING COMMANDS :
  1. 'Spacebar': While the simulation is running, press the spacebar to pause it. Press it again to resume the simulation.
  2. 'c': While the simulation is running, press the 'c' key to clear the grid (set all cells to dead).
  3. 'r': While the simulation is running, press the 'r' key to randomize the grid (set cells to either alive or dead randomly).
  4.Mouse Click: While the simulation is running, click on a cell in the grid to toggle its state between alive and dead. This allows you to interactively modify the grid.
-Conclusion
 •Recap: We've explored the significance of Conway's Game of Life.
 •Ongoing relevance: Continues to inspire research, creativity, and computational exploration.
